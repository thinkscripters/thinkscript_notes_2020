## 2020 Summer internship

## Goals:
- Learn how the stock market moves and how it changes throughout the day.
- Learn how to setup thinkorswim to your personal liking (ie. chart layouts, color coding)
- Gain an understanding for day trading with Thinkorswim.
- Learn how to write code with the built in language thinkscript.

## Getting into Thinkorswim: 
- We began with watching a series of udemy videos that taught us the basics of Thinkorswim.
- Udemy videos: https://worcester.udemy.com/organization/home/
- We learned about candles, how to recognize a possibly good trade, and to actually make a trade.
- We also learned about the different order types that could be made when we want to make a trade.
- Then we read through the Thinkorswim learning center were we learned what each tabs purpose was on the thinkorswim app.
- Thinkorswim learning center: https://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/howToTos/thinkManual/Getting-Started
- We then learned how to personalize our charts and import studies.


## Begin trading:
- We started off with 200k and began some group trading to gain an understanding of how the stock market moves throughout the day.
- We checked news articles each morning to see the predictions for a stock that day.
- We also watched a couple Youtube videos in our free time to help improve out knowledge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvcyLca2Dk
- Once we felt confidant in our ability to trade we began our 40k challenge were we were tasked to trades with a low amount of money.
- We then began creating studies of our own and using them in our trading.
- With our new studies we began a 60k challenge to see who could earn the most with their study.

## Learning Thinkscript:
- Thinkscript is a built in language for Thinkorswim.
- Using the Thinkorswim learning center we went through the chapters and learned how to code with thinkscript.
- Thinkscript learning center: https://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/reference/thinkScript
- We did some coding as a group to gain an understanding to how it works.
- We then created code that would indicate when to buy or sell a stock.

## Learning Resources:
- This website had some great sample code to test: https://funwiththinkscript.com/category/example-code/
- This was a good source of news on stocks: https://finance.yahoo.com/
